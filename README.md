# C# Projects

##### These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework during my time at The Tech Academy

### [Car Insurance](https://github.com/Jakersf/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/CarInsurance/CarInsurance)

##### This project is a Web Application using an MVC based design. It takes the user's input regarding their policy information, and returns them a quote using a simple chain of logic. The application also contains an admin view which allows any system admin to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### [Blackjack](https://github.com/Jakersf/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/BlackjackGame/BlackjackGame/Program.cs)

##### For this project, I created the popular game Twenty One, widely known as Blackjack. This application allows the user to play a game of Blackjack against the dealer in the console. I used Object Oriented Programming to create this application, representing everything to do with Blackjack using classes. This approach allowed the program to be built around those classes, and therefore the main implementation was logic.

### [NewsletterApp](https://github.com/Jakersf/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/NewsletterAppMVC/NewsletterAppMVC)

##### This project is a simple .NET MVC web applicaton that allows a user to signup for a newsletter. Their information is stored in a database using Entity Framework 6.
